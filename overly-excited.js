// Adding Conditions to the Loop

// Then add logic to addExcitement that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. 
//This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.

// Your job is to read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work.

// If the current value of the counter variable can be evenly divided by 3 - using the JavaScript 
//remainder operator - then add a single exclamation point (!) to the output.
// Example output:

// The
// The walrus
// The walrus danced!
// The walrus danced! through
// The walrus danced! through the
// The walrus danced! through the trees!
// The walrus danced! through the trees! in
// The walrus danced! through the trees! in the
// The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light!
// The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of
// The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of the
// The walrus danced! through the trees! in the light! of the moon!
// ...
// Challenge

// Add logic in the addExcitement function to the increase the number of exclamation points 
//after every third word. The number of exclamation points (!) will be determined by how many times 
//the counter variable can be divided by 3.

// Example output:

// The
// The walrus
// The walrus danced!
// The walrus danced! through
// The walrus danced! through the
// The walrus danced! through the trees!!
// The walrus danced! through the trees!! in
// The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the
// The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!!
// The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of
// The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of the
// The walrus danced! through the trees!! in the light!!! of the moon!!!!
